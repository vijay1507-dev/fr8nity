# Member Directory Filter Implementation

## Overview
The member directory includes a comprehensive filtering system that allows users to search for members based on multiple criteria. The filter operates on button-click only, providing users with full control over when filtering occurs.

## Features

### Filter Criteria
1. **Company Name**: Search by company name or member name
2. **Country**: Filter by country
3. **City**: Filter by city
4. **Specialization**: Search within member specializations

### User Experience Features
- **Button-triggered filtering**: Filter only applies when user clicks the "Filter" button
- **Loading states**: Visual feedback during filtering with spinner
- **Clear filters**: Easy way to reset all filters
- **Keyboard support**: Enter key triggers filtering from any input field
- **Responsive design**: Works on all device sizes
- **Auto-focus**: First input field is focused on page load

## Technical Implementation

- Maintains existing design structure

### View Changes

### JavaScript Features
